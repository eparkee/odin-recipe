    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Meatballs:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, minced garlic, chopped onions, chopped cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, mix all the ingredients until well combined.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1-2 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Cook the Meatballs:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are cooked through and browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the meatballs from the oven and set them aside.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add diced onions and minced garlic to the pan and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cumin, chili powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Combine Meatballs and Sauce:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked meatballs to the sauce and gently stir to coat them evenly.</li>
        <li>Continue simmering for an additional 5-10 minutes to let the meatballs absorb the flavors of the sauce.</li>
